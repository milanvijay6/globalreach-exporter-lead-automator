========================================
AZURE OAUTH REDIRECT URIs - ADD BOTH
========================================

Add these TWO URLs to Azure Portal:

1. PRIMARY (Cloudflare Tunnel):
   https://wheel-baking-survivors-budgets.trycloudflare.com/api/oauth/callback

2. BACKUP (localhost):
   http://localhost:4000/api/oauth/callback

========================================
HOW TO ADD IN AZURE PORTAL:
========================================

1. Go to: https://portal.azure.com
2. App registrations → Your app → Authentication
3. Under "Platform configurations" → "Web"
4. Add BOTH URLs (one per line or separate entries)
5. Click "Save"
6. Wait 3-5 minutes

========================================
HOW THE APP WORKS:
========================================

- App tries Cloudflare URL FIRST (if tunnel is running)
- Falls back to localhost if Cloudflare URL not available
- Both URLs must be in Azure Portal for this to work

========================================
